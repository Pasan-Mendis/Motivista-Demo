I collaborated closely with stakeholders to gather requirements and understand their vision. The redesign focused on enhancing user experience and modernizing the visual appeal. I created wireframes and mockups to present design concepts. Feedback from the client was incorporated at every stage. The new design emphasized intuitive navigation and accessibility. I implemented a responsive layout to ensure compatibility across devices. The color scheme was updated to align with the client's brand identity. Typography choices were made to improve readability and professionalism. I optimized images and assets for faster loading times. The homepage was restructured to highlight key services and offerings. Interactive elements were added to engage visitors. I integrated a content management system for easy updates. SEO best practices were followed to improve search engine rankings.
